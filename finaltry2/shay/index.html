        <p> Shayna is one of my best friends, and one of my favorite people to photograph because she never gets awkward in front of the camera. Below are some pictures that I took at the Vegabond Motel *I inlcuded the iframe of its location below.* (I also bought all the clothes for this shoot on Nasty Gal and then returned it *sorry Nasty Gal.)</p>
