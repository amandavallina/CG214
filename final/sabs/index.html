Sabrina is my tallest most actual model looking friend, shes a giant she's almost six feet tall and rail thin. Shes also a brain and majoring in engineering last summer she taught children 4-10 in an after school program about coding and robotics.She's also  not socially awkward either. She's another favorite of mine to take photos of because her height makes all the clothes I put on her look like a billion dollars.
