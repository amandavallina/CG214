		<h1>About me , (Amanda Vallina!)</h1>
		<div class="div1">
			<h3>Miami,Florida</h3>
			I was born and raised in Miami,Florida. I'm 100% cuban and I'm the first one in my family to go away for college. I went to a small catholic private school called Archbishop Mccarthy. (We were the first ones to use ipads instead of books,so 21st century of us!!!) I live in a town called Southwest Ranches that was originally all Everglades but got transformed into a town full of horses somehow.

		<div class="div2">
			<h3>Currently</h3>
			I am currently enrolled in The Fashion Institute of Technology majoring in photography and minoring in art history. I live next to Bryant Park with my friend Margaret.
